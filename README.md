# L4D2-Decompiled-Assets

Various types of decompiled or referential Retail L4D2 assets.

Map decompiles used BSPSource 1.4.0 with all default settings.

See "File Hashes and Information.txt" for MD5, SHA1, File Sizes and more.

# Folders

Commentary PC Live (Latest Only):

	Best PC _commentary.txt files. TLS Community Updates reduce some
	File Sizes due to optimization, VScript conversion, or integration
	into *.LMP files. Very high entropy.

Commentary Survivors Arcade (Largest Only):

	Best L4D: Survivors Arcade (Taito) _commentary.txt files. These
	were only made larger from _dlc1-3 to update. Negligible entropy.

Decompiled Dedicated Server VMF's (Excludes LMP's):

	L4D2 Dedicated Servers (accidentally?) ship some extra map files,
	so all the originals plus those new ones are decompiled here.

Decompiled PC Live VMF's (Excludes LMP's):

	Live game map decompiles. TLS Community Update shipped 100's of
	small Entity Lump only map fixes (most of them Survival-only),
	so caution that all *.LMP file changes are excluded.

Decompiled Survivors Arcade VMF's:

	L4D: Survivors Arcade (Taito) map decompiles. Taito was allowed
	to recompile the maps; however, for PC updates, we are strictly
	forbidden from doing so due to testing costs and risks.

	See "File Hashes and Information.txt" for hashes of original BSP's
	and other files under "Extracted Survivors Arcade Originals".
